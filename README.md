# Port-Knocking-Windows
A Windows Port Knocking Script
@echo off: This is a command to turn off the echoing of commands to the command prompt. It ensures that only the output of the script will be displayed, and not the commands themselves.

REM: This is a remark or comment, used to provide explanations or instructions within a batch script. It does not affect the execution of the script.

setlocal: This command starts a local scope for variables, which means any variables defined or modified within this scope will not affect the global environment variables.

set "IP_ADDRESS=YOUR_IP_GOES_HERE": This defines a variable named IP_ADDRESS and sets its value to the IP address that needs to be "knocked" or connected to. The placeholder "YOUR_IP_GOES_HERE" should be replaced with the actual IP address.

set "PORTS=1234 5678 43764 9012": This defines a variable named PORTS and sets its value to a list of port numbers separated by spaces. These are the ports that will be "knocked" or connected to in the loop that follows.

for %%p in (%PORTS%) do (...): This is a loop that iterates over the list of port numbers stored in the PORTS variable. The loop variable %%p will take each port number one by one, and the commands inside the parentheses (...) will be executed for each iteration.

powershell -c "(New-Object Net.Sockets.TcpClient).Connect('%IP_ADDRESS%', %%p)": This is a PowerShell command that creates a new TCP client object and uses it to connect to the IP address and port number specified in the loop. This effectively sends a TCP packet to "knock" on the port, attempting to establish a connection.

ping -n 5 127.0.0.1 > nul: This is a ping command that sends five pings to the loopback address 127.0.0.1, which is a way to introduce a delay in the script. The output of the ping command is redirected to nul, so that the output is suppressed and not displayed.

:: End of script: This is another remark or comment, indicating the end of the script.

Note: Please be cautious when using or modifying scripts that involve network operations, as they can potentially have security implications. Always ensure that you have proper authorization and permissions to perform such operations, and validate the script thoroughly before executing it.
